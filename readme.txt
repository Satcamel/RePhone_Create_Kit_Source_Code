## Scriven42's Modified RePhone Kit Create Source Code

-Added a keyboard to type new messages, not just send pre-written canned messages.
-Changed the "no sim" background back to black.
-Added a second home screen, and rearranged the icon layout. New layout is:
	Home:	Call, Settings, SMS
		Actions, ITTT, Home2
	Home2: Home, Sensors, GPS (label only, does nothing)
		  Info, (rest unused)
-Added the Info screen, to use for debug information.
